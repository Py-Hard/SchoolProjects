Ah, light mode. Bold choice.
Almonds are supposed to be brown, not white.
As The Weeknd once said: "Ooooh, I'm blinded by the lights" — which, honestly, is exactly what you're doing to yourself with light mode.
Every time you unlock your phone, a small part of your soul dies screaming while your pupils dilate in pure terror, you sadistic bastard.
Flashbang!
Future you is going to be that guy in thick-ass Coke-bottle glasses wondering why everything’s blurry, and present you is the asshole who deserves every second of it.
Go on. Turn the brightness up. See what happens
Honestly, respect. I can't even open Stack Overflow at 3 AM without shielding my eyes like a Victorian child seeing electricity for the first time.
I can't believe I made this just to roast light mode users. But someone had to do it.
I love how you open your laptop and instantly recreate the experience of looking directly at the sun. Inspirational.
I'm a developer, so trust me: if I wanted to blind myself, I'd just open my error logs.
Keep it up, champion. Darwin's watching and taking notes.
Light mode detected. Judging silently.
Light mode in 2026 is like smoking unfiltered cigarettes while skydiving without a parachute—legendary commitment to fucking yourself over.
Light mode in 2026? Congratulations, you're the last surviving caveman still afraid of the dark, you primitive fuck.
Light mode users don't have seasonal depression—they have permanent retinal depression, you glowing war criminal.

Light mode? Honk honk.
Light mode? Interesting. I guess some people enjoy pain.
Light mode? Jesus fucking Christ, what kind of self-destructive psychopath are you?
Light mode? That's not a preference, that's a fucking suicide pact with your corneas.
Light mode? Wow. Someone watched Barbie and thought, "Yes. More pink. More light. More pain."

Light mode: The Retinas Strike Back.
Must feel good to stare into the fucking blazing sun!
Must feel good to stare into the fucking sun!
Must feel good to stare into the blazing sun!
Must feel good to stare into the sun!
Oi hoom, stop acting like you need light mode to stay alive. You're not a succulent.
Oi hoom… you're not a succulent.
Oi human, you're not a fern. Light mode isn't sunlight, calm down.
Oi, you're not a plant. Light mode isn't going to help you grow.
Respect for the dedication, though. Not many people hate themselves enough to turn their daily computing experience into a personal Guantanamo Bay for their own fucking face.
Running light mode in 2025? Brave.
Switch to dark mode? Nah, you'd rather marinate your corneas in pure suffering until they're well-done.
Wait… you're not a vampire too?
Wow. Light mode. Didn't expect that from you.
You absolute light-mode-loving, vision-gambling, retina-roasting, self-hating, photon-chugging, glare-guzzling, masochistic piece of shit. Repent before it's too late.
You looked at dark mode once, said "nah, too gentle," and decided to waterboard your eyes with photons instead, you deranged fuck.
You must be a developer too — only someone who's already emotionally numb could tolerate that much brightness.
You must enjoy pain. Good for you...
You must really love being blinded.
You might as well try Comic Sans too!
You open your phone and instantly recreate the experience of staring into a car's high beams.
You wake up every morning, open your laptop, and voluntarily choose to stare into a digital abyss of pure white agony like your retinas personally murdered your family.
You're not "productive," you're just hate-crime-ing your own eyeballs on a daily basis, you absolute menace to vision.
You're not a plant. Stop trying to photosynthesize your way through the internet.
You're not a sunflower. Stop turning toward the light.
You're not browsing — you're flashbanging yourself.
You're not browsing—you're performing self-inflicted chemical burns on your retinas and calling it "aesthetic."
You're out here using light mode like your retinas have a warranty.
You're the kind of person who uses light mode and then wonders why your battery dies in 20 minutes.
You're the reason eye doctors send their kids to college. They see your chart coming and start counting the yacht payments.
Your brightness is cranked so high, cockroaches in your room are developing sunglasses.
Your brightness settings violate the Geneva Conventions.
Your eyes aren't adapting. They're plotting revenge. One day they'll just quit, and you'll 100% deserve that blindness, you incandescent idiot.
Your life depends on the sun, but not this one.
Your relationship with light mode is the strongest commitment you've ever made, and it shows.
Your retinas must be bulletproof.
Your screen could power a small city, yet you're using it to read Reddit threads. Priorities on fucking point.
Your screen is so blinding I'm convinced you're trying to tan indoors.
Your screen is so bright it could guide ships at night.
Your screen is so bright I'm surprised you haven't accidentally git push'd your retinas to permanent damage.
Your screen is so goddamn bright it could land planes. The FAA is filing noise complaints about your fucking display.
